class WgmmaInstructionGroup(InstructionGroup):
    """Warp Group Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (WGMMA) instructions for Hopper GPUs.

    WGMMA performs asynchronous matrix multiply-accumulate operations using a **warp group**
    (4 consecutive warps, 128 threads). The operands reside in shared memory (``a``, ``b``) or
    registers (``a``), and the accumulator (``d``) is in registers.

    WGMMA operations are asynchronous and must follow a strict execution protocol:

    1. ``fence()`` — establish memory ordering so prior writes to operands are visible.
    2. ``mma()`` — issue one or more async MMA operations (can be called multiple times).
    3. ``commit_group()`` — group all pending MMAs into a commit group.
    4. ``wait_group(n)`` — wait until at most ``n`` commit groups remain pending.

    Multiple commit groups can be in flight simultaneously for latency hiding in pipelined
    loops. For example, issue new MMAs while waiting for a previous group to complete.

    All WGMMA instructions must be executed by a full warp group (4 warps). Use
    ``self.warp_group()`` to create the appropriate thread group context.

        ordering between generic memory accesses and subsequent wgmma operations.
