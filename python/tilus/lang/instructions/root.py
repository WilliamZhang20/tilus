        Given a seed scalar and an offset register tensor, returns a register tensor
        of random float32 values following a standard normal distribution, using the
        Box-Muller transform.

        Parameters
        ----------
        seed: Expr | int
            The seed for generating random numbers (uint64 scalar).
        offset: RegisterTensor
            The offsets to generate random numbers for (uint32).
        n_rounds: int
            Number of Philox rounds (default 10).

        Returns
        -------
        ret: RegisterTensor
            A register tensor of random float32 values ~ N(0, 1) with the same shape as ``offset``.

        -----
        - **Thread group**: Can be executed by any sized thread group.
